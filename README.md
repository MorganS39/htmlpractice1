# htmlpractice1
Html practice website to start learning framework and best practices.

This will be my first Github html page that will use as many different types of tags and syntax as possible in order to practice.
My main purpose for this is to take all that I already know and actually put it onto Github as well as test myself and learn new things.
Any feedback or comments are welcome, I am always willing to learn and take any opinions or criticism in order to get better.
